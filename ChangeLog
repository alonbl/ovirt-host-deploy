 * legacy-change: io elevator scheduler set in kernel command-line
   use either udev rule in vdsm package or tuned.

 * legacy-change: vdsm libvirt reconfigure
   vdsm is reconfigured with file based trigger instead unsupported systemd
   init.d parameter.

 * legacy-change: distribution checks are simpler based on Python platform,
   minimum:
   - rhel-6.2
   - fedora-17

 * legacy-change: minimum vdsm version is taken from engine not hard coded.

 * legacy-change: pki is now using m2crypto to generate certificate request
   and parse certificates.

 * legacy-change: use iproute2 instead of python ethtool to avoid another
   dependency for host name validation.

 * legacy-change: use iproute2 instead of reading /proc/net/route for route
   information and interface information.

 * legacy-change: do not use vdsm.netinfo for vlan and bonding as it requires
   /usr/share/vdsm modules, and it is trivial anyway.

 * legacy-change: use vdsm-store-net-config script to commit network config
   instead of internal duplicate implementation.

 * legacy-change: /etc/vdsm/vdsm.conf is overridden unless VDSM/configOverride
   environment is set to True

 * legacy-change: /etc/vdsm/vdsm.conf is not read of fake_qemu.
   set VDSM/checkVirtHardware environment to False to avoid hardware detection.

 * legacy-change: following gluster packages not installed:
   - glusterfs-rdma
   - glusterfs-geo-replication
